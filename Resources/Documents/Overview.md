## About

Version 1.2 of FreeCAD introduced several important improvements to the CAM Workbench, notably **multi-axis operations** and **machine-based postprocessing**. Both features require an accurate digital representation of your physical CNC machine.

This addon makes a curated collection of community-created machine definitions available through the FreeCAD Addon Manager.

## Machine Definitions (.fcm)

Each machine definition is a JSON file with the `.fcm` extension. It contains:

- Kinematics and axis configuration
- Physical characteristics and working envelope
- The recommended postprocessor
- Configuration options for G-code customization

## FAQ

### 1) How do I contribute to this collection?

1. Create and test your machine definition in FreeCAD.
2. Fork this repository.
3. Place your `.fcm` file in the appropriate directory.
4. Open a Pull Request.

We welcome well-tested machines!

### 2) We are a company that makes CNC machines. Can we make our machine definitions available in our own addon?

**Yes!** Fork this repository, customize the branding and content, and publish it as your own addon through the FreeCAD Addon Manager.

### 3) My machine isn't available here. How do I create it?

FreeCAD includes built-in tools for defining machines in the CAM workbench. Create the `.fcm` file (either through the UI or by editing JSON), test it thoroughly, and then consider submitting it back to the community.

### 4) None of the available postprocessors does what I need.

You have multiple paths forward:

- Enhance an existing postprocessor and submit a Pull Request to the [FreeCAD project](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD)
- Develop a new postprocessor for the official FreeCAD repository
- Create a custom postprocessor and release it as a community addon
- Keep your postprocessor private for internal use

## Installation

**Recommended method:**

1. In FreeCAD, open **Tools → Addon Manager**
2. Search for "**Machines**"
3. Click **Install**

After installation (and a possible restart), your machines will be available in the CAM Job setup.
